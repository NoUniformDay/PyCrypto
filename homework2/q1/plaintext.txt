It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to\nfind himself writing about mathematics. The function of a\nmathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to add\nto mathematics, and not to talk about what he or other mathema \nticians have done. Statesmen despise publicists, painters despise\nart critics, and physiologists, physicists, or mathematicians have\nusually similar feelings: there is no scorn more profound, or on\nthe whole more justifiable, than that of the men who make for the\nmen who explain. Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for\nsecond rate minds.\n\n   I can remember arguing this point once in one of the few\nserious conversations that I ever had with Housman. Housman, in\nhis Leslie Stephen lecture The Name and Nature of Poetry, had\ndenied very emphatically that he was a    critic   ; but he had denied\nit in what seemed to me a singularly perverse way, and had\nexpressed an admiration for literary criticism which startled and\nscandalized me.\n\n   He had begun with a quotation from his inaugural lecture,\ndelivered twenty two years before   \n\n         Whether the faculty of literary criticism is the best\n      gift that Heaven has in its treasures, I cannot say; but\n      Heaven seems to think so, for assuredly it is the gift\n      most charily bestowed. Orators and poets..., if rare in\n      comparison with blackberries, are commoner than re \n      turns of Halley s comet: literary critics are less com \n      mon...\n\nAnd he had continued   \n\n         In these twenty two years I have improved in some\n      respects and deteriorated in others, but I have not so\n      much improved as to become a literary critic, nor so\n      much deteriorated as to fancy that I have become one.\n\nIt had seemed to me deplorable that a great scholar and a fine\npoet should write like this, and, finding myself next to him in\nHall a few weeks later, I plunged in and said so. Did he really\nmean what he had said to be taken very seriously  Would the life\nof the best of critics really have seemed to him comparable with\nthat of a scholar and a poet  We argued the questions all through\ndinner, and I think that finally he agreed with me. I must not seem\nto claim a dialectical triumph over a man who can no longer\ncontradict me, but    Perhaps not entirely    was, in the end, his reply\nto the first question, and    Probably no    to the second.\n\n   There may have been some doubt about Housman s feelings,\nand I do not wish to claim him as on my side; but there is no\ndoubt at all about the feelings of men of science, and I share them\nfully. If then I find myself writing, not mathematics, but    about   \nmathematics, it is a confession of weakness, for which I may\nrightly be scorned or pitied by younger and more vigorous\nmathematicians. I write about mathematics because, like any\nother mathematician who has passed sixty, I have no longer the\nfreshness of mind, the energy, or the patience to carry on\neffectively with my proper job.\n
